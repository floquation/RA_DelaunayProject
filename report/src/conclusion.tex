\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have looked at two algorithms for Delaunay triangulation. 
The triangulation methods have been implemented and their performances as function of the input have been compared when ran on a set of randomly generated vertices.
The difference in runtime was pretty marginal, although Bowyer-Watson seemed to perform slightly faster in our tests.
Furthermore we have looked at Rupperts refinement algorithm and how it performs on the boundary of a car as a function of the maximum area of each triangle and the minimum angle in each triangle.
It seemed like Ruppert as most likely to converge when the minimum angle was about $23^\degr$.
It also seemed like that for maximum width even multitudes of $50$ seemed to perform well.
%I'm not sure why since intuitively I would expect that looser constraints are easier to satisfy than strict ones.
Intuitively, looser constraints would be easier to satisfy than strict ones, so these results came as a surprise.
The result might be specific to the structure of the boundary that we were examining.
