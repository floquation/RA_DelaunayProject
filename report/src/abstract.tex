%     We study the performance of several Delaunay triangulation and refinement algorithms.
%     The Delaunay triangulation algorithms which we look into are Bowyer-Watson and Lawson.
%     %Lawson's algorithm makes use of edge flips whereas Ruppert's algorithm avoids these.
%     The Delaunay refinement algorithm which we look into is from Ruppert.
%     We also discuss Chew's second refinement algorithm, but we didn't got it implemented succesfully within the time constraints.
%     We look at the runtime of both triangulation and refinement algorithms for different requirements and study its behaviour.
%     Although the Delaunay algorithms have a linear runtime complexity in theory, 
%     the results indicate that our implementations require exponential time.

We study the runtime of two different Delaunay triangulation algorithms: Lawson's and Bowyer-Watson's.
This was done for the case with and without the inclusion of PSLG boundary segments.
Theoretically, these algorithms should have an $O(n)$ complexity, while our implementation behaves exponentially in $n$.
The difference between Lawson and Bowyer-Watson was marginal.

Then, we studied the behaviour of Ruppert's Delaunay refinement algorithm.
This too is exponential in $n$, which is caused by its dependency on the previous two algorithms.
As a function of the termination criterea of the refinement algorithm (minimum angle within a triangle and maximum area of a triangle),
it was found that both tight as loose criterea are bad for convergence.
The best rate of convergence was found for a minimum angle of about $21\degr$.
The convergence behaviour as a function of the maximum area is a complex function dependent on the shape of the boundary.
