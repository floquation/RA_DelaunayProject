\begin{abstract}
We study the runtime of two different Delaunay triangulation algorithms: Lawson's and Bowyer-Watson's.
Theoretically, these algorithms should have an $O(n)$ complexity, while our implementation behaves exponentially in $n$.

Then, we studied the behaviour of Ruppert's Delaunay refinement algorithm.
