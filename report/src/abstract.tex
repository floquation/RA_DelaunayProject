\begin{abstract}
    We study the performance of several Delaunay triangulation and refinement algorithms.
    The Delaunay triangulation algorithms which we look into are Bowyer-Watson and Lawson.
    %Lawson's algorithm makes use of edge flips whereas Ruppert's algorithm avoids these.
    The Delaunay refinement algorithm which we look into is from Ruppert.
    We also discuss Chew's second refinement algorithm, but we didn't got it implemented succesfully within the time constraints.
    We look at the runtime of both triangulation and refinement algorithms for different requirements and study its behaviour.
    Although the Delaunay algorithms have a linear runtime complexity in theory, 
    the results indicate that our implementations require exponential time.

%We study the runtime of two different Delaunay triangulation algorithms: Lawson's and Bowyer-Watson's.
%Theoretically, these algorithms should have an $O(n)$ complexity, while our implementation behaves exponentially in $n$.

%Then, we studied the behaviour of Ruppert's Delaunay refinement algorithm.
