\subsection{Delaunay triangulation algorithm}
\label{sub:results:triangulation}

We tested the Bowyer-Watson and Lawson triangulation algorithms for randomly generated inputs of different size.
%This is done by recursively adding $n$ points to the initial triangulation.

For each input size, 40 trials were performed.
In Figure \ref{fig:triangulation-runtime} we can see the average time that was needed for inserting the points.
We see that both algorithms don't differ much from each other, but Lawson's triangulation method seems slighty faster than Bowyer-Watsons.

%The result without PSLG boundary segments is shown in Figure \ref{fig:triangulation/runtime} and
%with the segments in Figure \ref{fig:result_runtimeSegments}.

We repeated the same experiments for a constrained triangulation problem.
In addition to the random generated vertices, we now added a PSLG that contrained the way in way the triangulation is performed.
The results are in Figure \ref{fig:triangulation-pslg-runtime}.
Again the difference between the methods is fairly small.

\subsection{Ruppert's refinement algorithm}
\label{sub:results:ruppert}

Ruppert's algorithm has been ran on the boundary of a car while two parameters of the algorithm were varied:
The maximum area of each triangle was restricted to values ranging from $50$ to $300$ and
the minimum angle in each triangle was restricted to values ranging from $10\degr$ to $300\degr$.
As a triangulation method we used Lawson, but since the graphs in Figure \ref{fig:triangulation-pslg-runtime} are close to each other, the result would likely be similar if Bowyer-Watson had been used.
An example of a triangulation obtained by running Rupperts algorithm can be found in Figure \ref{fig:result_Car20}.
Unfortunately, the algorithm didn't converge for each setting, so the experiments were cut off when they ran for more than $10$ seconds.

In Figure \ref{fig:ruppert-runtime} we see the runtime for different minimum angles and in Figure \ref{fig:ruppert-runtime2} we see the runtime for different maximum areas.
In Figure \ref{fig:ruppert-runtime} we notice that the algorithm seems to converge fastest when we limit the smallest angle to about $23\degr$.
When the angles are either big or small, the algorithm converges at a much slower rate.
In Figure \ref{fig:ruppert-runtime2} it can be seen that making the maximum area bigger generally makes the runtime slightly slower.
%Surprisingly, setups in which the maximum area is divisible by 100 seem to converge faster than other setups.
Surprisingly we see that at certain minimum angles, the algorithm does converge when the maximum area is an even multitude of 50 ($0, 100, 200, \ldots$), but not when the maximum area is an uneven multitude of 50 ($50, 150, 250, \ldots$).
